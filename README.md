## Welcome to the GIFTR APP
- Created using Flutter, this app lets you add birthdays of your friends and family. 
- You can also add multiple gift ideas(with details like price, store, etc) for the people added.
- You can register for an account using an email address and password and login to see the people you have added.
- The UI consists of multiple pages having a common AppBar and uses list tiles to display list of people/gifts.
- Multiple validations have been added on login/registration page as well as people and gifts related screens that prompt user to correct input dynamically.
-This front end is linked to a backend nodeJS server that is coded to handles all CRUD routes and that uses mongoDB.
